### ARCHITECURE OF THE LIBRARY
The library has 2 classes. Restaurant and Review. They intersect at the addReview 
instance method of the Restaurant class. the reviews are stored as a linked list
and when a new review classs is instantiated, the addreview method recalculates 
the review for the restaurant


### HOW TO TEST THE CODE
Instantiate objects of Restaurant and Review classes and use them to reference
the different methods of the classes. Additionally, the state of each class can
be referenced directly and confirmed independently to be working. the tests
performed alongside this code corroborates that the code works great.
